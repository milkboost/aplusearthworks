Place the pool image here so the site displays it:

Save the attached image from the chat as:

images/pool-installation.jpg

From PowerShell you can run (from the project root):

    mkdir images
    # then copy the downloaded file into images\pool-installation.jpg

If you'd like, paste the image content here (or upload again) and I can embed it directly into `index.html` as a data URL instead.
